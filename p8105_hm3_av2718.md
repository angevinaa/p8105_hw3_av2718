library(dplyr)
```

## Problem 2

This problem focuses on the Accelerometers data. Below we import and
clean data from `accel_data.csv`. The process begins with importing the
data and cleaning the variables names:

``` r
library(readr)
accel_data = read_csv("data/accel_data.csv") %>% #import data
  janitor::clean_names() %>% # tidy variable names
  mutate_if(is.double, as.numeric) #if double mutate variable to   numeric
```

We quickly recognize a problem: the `activity` data is spread across
1443 columns, which correspond to 1443 activity counts for each minute
of a 24-hour day. To address this and organize the data, we will use
`pivot_longer`to wangle the activity data and create two new variables
`workweek` and `weekday`:

``` r
accel_data_tidy =  
  pivot_longer(   # organize activity data 
    accel_data,
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "time_course",
    values_to = "activity_count",
    names_prefix = "activity_"                  
  ) %>%
  mutate(.data = .,  # new weekday vs weekend variable
         workweek = if_else(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday"),
         weekday = fct_relevel(day, "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")) 

head(accel_data_tidy, 8) #view first 8 rows of tidied data
## # A tibble: 8 × 7
##    week day_id day    time_course activity_count workweek weekday
##   <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>                <dbl> <chr>    <fct>  
## 1     1      1 Friday 1                     88.4 weekday  Friday 
## 2     1      1 Friday 2                     82.2 weekday  Friday 
## 3     1      1 Friday 3                     64.4 weekday  Friday 
## 4     1      1 Friday 4                     70.0 weekday  Friday 
## 5     1      1 Friday 5                     75.0 weekday  Friday 
## 6     1      1 Friday 6                     66.3 weekday  Friday 
## 7     1      1 Friday 7                     53.8 weekday  Friday 
## 8     1      1 Friday 8                     47.8 weekday  Friday
```

The resulting dataset has only 6 variables: activity_count, day, day_id,
time_course, week, weekday, workweek, and a size of 50400, 7. Using this
tidied dataset, we will now aggregate across minutes to create a
`total_activity` variable for each day, and create a table showing these
totals:

``` r
total_activity = accel_data_tidy %>%  
  group_by(day,week) %>%           #Group total activity by day and week 
  summarize(day_total = sum(activity_count)) %>% 
  mutate(week = as.character(week))


pivot_wider(                 #Create friendly table for "human readers"
  total_activity,
  names_from = "day",
  values_from = "day_total"
)
## # A tibble: 5 × 8
##   week   Friday  Monday Saturday Sunday Thursday Tuesday Wednesday
##   <chr>   <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl>  <dbl>    <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>
## 1 1     480543.  78828.   376254 631105  355924. 307094.   340115.
## 2 2     568839  295431    607175 422018  474048  423245    440962 
## 3 3     467420  685910    382928 467052  371230  381507    468869 
## 4 4     154049  409450      1440 260617  340291  319568    434460 
## 5 5     620860  389080      1440 138421  549658  367824    445366
```

As expected, from the table, we can observe different total activity
levels depending on the day of the week. The patient seems to be more
active during the weekdays. However, the data presented in this table
isn’t enough to make any conclusions. We would need to conduct further
analysis. Nonetheless, from this table, we can observe on Saturday, in
weeks 4 and 5, two unusual measurements, possibly due to a device
malfunction. It’s good that we noticed this issue, as it would affect
our analysis and results.

We will now use what we have learned in class to the inspection activity
over the course of the day. In the code chuck below we will create a
single-panel `plot` that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for
each day and use color to indicate the day of the week:

``` r
f1 = ggplot(accel_data_tidy, aes(x = time_course, y = activity_count, color = day))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+  # Legend in bottom
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+ # Center ggplot title
  labs(
    title = "24-hour Accelerometer Activity Count for Each Week Day",
    x = "Time Course (Minutes)",
    y = "Activity Count",
  )

f1
```

Based on this graph, we can say that the patient’s physical activity
fluctuates across the day. In general, we observe peak activity early in
the day and a decrease in activity count during the middle of the day.
During the weekdays, the patient seems to be more active in the morning
and less active at night. On Saturday and Sunday, we observe more
physical activity both in the morning and at night. However, it’s
difficult to describe a specific pattern or make a definite conclusion
based on this graph alone.
